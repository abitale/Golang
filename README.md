# Golang
First thing to do is to enter one of the directories either simple-api or web-api then you can run:
### `go run main.go`

## simple-api
In case of simple-api, you need to run:
### `mongo`
to activate the mongo database, and don't forget to edit the `main.go` file to match the mongodb port.
## web-api
